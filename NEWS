
Package: R.devices
==================

Version: 2.9.2 [2014-05-15]
o Bumped up the package dependencies.


Version: 2.9.1 [2014-05-01]
o Added withPar() for plotting with temporarily set graphical parameters.


Version: 2.9.0 [2014-04-28]
o Added toDefault() for plotting to the default device analogously to
  how the other toNnn() device functions works.  Likewise, added toX11(),
  toWindows(), toQuartz(), toCairoWin(), toCairoX11(), and toJavaGD()
  for plotting to interactive/screen devices.
o Now it's possible to use devEval() to open a new or activate an
  existing interactive/screen device.
o Added support for (hidden) argument 'which' to devNew(), such that
  devNew(type, which=which) avoids opening a new device iff an existing
  device of the same device type and index/label already is opened.
  For instance, calling devNew("X11", which="foo") will open an X11
  device and label it 'foo'.  Subsequent calls will set the focus that
  same device.
o BUG FIX: Now devEval("windows", { plot(1:10) }) no longer gives
  "Error: Detected new graphics devices that was opened but not
  closed while executing devEval(): '2' (windows)".
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 2.8.4 [2014-01-11]
o Added asDataURI() for converting an image file to an
  Base64-encoded data URI character string.


Version: 2.8.3 [2014-01-10]
o Added toFavicon() for outputting figures as HTML favicons.


Version: 2.8.2 [2014-01-02]
o Now the timestamp of the default path for devDump() is in the
  current time zone.


Version: 2.8.1 [2013-12-08]
o BUG FIX: devOptions(types) would drop all options for combinations
  of device types that have identical sets of options, e.g.
  types=c("png", "png") or types=c("bmp", "png").
o CLEANUP: Bumped up package dependencies. No longer need for an ad hoc
  NAMESPACE import.


Version: 2.8.0 [2013-10-29]
o Added devDump() which is short for calling devEval(c("png", "pdf"),
  ..., which=devList(interactiveOnly=TRUE)), i.e. it copies the content
  of open interactive ("screen") devices.
o Added argument 'interactiveOnly' to devList().
o If 'expr' is missing, devEval() copies the current active device
  and devEval(which=devList()) copies all open devices.  For example,
  plot(1:10); devEval(c("png", "jpg", "pdf"), name="myfig").
o Now package imports (no longer suggests) the 'base64enc' package.
  This way packages using 'R.devices' do not have to specify also
  'base64enc' if they use dataURI-encoding of images.
o ROBUSTNESS/BUG FIX: devSet(which) where 'which' is a very large number
  could leave lots of stray temporary devices open when error "too many
  open devices" occurred.  Now all temporary devices are guaranteed to
  be closed also when there is an error.
o BUG FIX: devIsOpen(), dev(Get|Set)Label(which) would not handle the
  case when the device was specified by an numeric 'which' and there is
  a gap in the device list.


Version: 2.7.3 [2013-10-28]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now devSet() is guaranteed to close all temporary
  devices it opens.


Version: 2.7.2 [2013-10-15]
o Now the package vignettes are in vignettes/ and not in inst/doc/,
  which will not be supported by R (>= 3.1.0).
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package system tests for devSet().


Version: 2.7.1 [2013-10-07]
o CLEANUP: Now explicitly importing only what is needed in NAMESPACE.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 2.7.0 [2013-09-28]
o GENERALIZATION: Vectorized devEval(), e.g. it is now possible to
  do devEval(c("png", "pdf"), name="MyPlot", { plot(1:10) }).
  Added arguments 'initially' and 'finally' to devEval().  Contrary
  to 'expr' which is evaluated for each graphics type/device, these
  are evaluated only once per call.  This makes it possible to avoid
  repeating expensive computations.
o GENERALIZATION: Vectorized devIsInteractive(), devIsOpen(),
  devGetLabel(), devOff() and devDone().
o Now devOff() and devDone() checks if device is opened before trying
  to close it.  This avoids opening and closing of non-opened devices.
o Updated the formal defaults of several devEval() arguments to be
  NULL.  Instead, NULL for such arguments are translated to default
  internally.  This was necessary in order to vectorize devEval().
o Now the 'R.devices' Package object is also available when the
  package is only loaded (but not attached).
o CONSISTENCY: Now devList() returns an empty integer vector
  (instead of NULL) if no open devices exists.
o ROBUSTNESS: The device functions that are not vectorize do now
  throw an informative error if passed a vector.
o ROBUSTNESS: Added several more package system tests.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now declaring all S3 method in NAMESPACE.
o CLEANUP: Removed fall back attachments of 'R.utils' as these
  are no longer needed with R.oo (>= 1.15.1).


Version: 2.6.1 [2013-09-17]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now getDataURI() throws an Exception is suggested
  package 'base64enc' is not installed.
o BUG FIX: Some package examples and system tests assumed that
  the suggested package 'base64enc' is installed.
o BUG FIX: Package vignette assumed that R.rsp and R.utils
  are attached.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 2.6.0 [2013-08-29]
o Added support for retrieving a Base64-encoded data URI string
  from a DevEvalFile.
o Added classes DevEvalProduct and DevEvalFileProduct, which are
  returned by devEval().
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package system tests.


Version: 2.5.2 [2013-08-27]
o Added devIsInteractive().
o CLEANUP: Package no longer utilizes ':::'.
o BUG FIX: Now devEval() no longer passes a pathname to devEval() for
  interactive devices, which in turn would generate warnings.


Version: 2.5.1 [2013-08-17]
o BUG FIX/ROBUSTNESS: Argument 'ext' of devEval() can now be inferred
  from argument 'type' also when 'type' is passed via a string variable.


Version: 2.5.0 [2013-07-30]
o Added support the 'win.metafile' (WMF) device type and added toWMF()
  creating (extended) WMF files.  Since the file format is *extended*
  WMF, which often has file extension *.emf, toEMF() was also added.
  toEMF() uses the same device driver as toWMF() with the only
  difference that the file extension is *.emf instead of *.wmf.
o Now devOptions() can query the options of multiple device types.
  Added arguments 'options' and 'drop' to devOptions().
o Now devEval() returns a list of class 'DevEvalFile'.
o DOCUMENTATION: Hiding internal/legacy functions from the help index.


Version: 2.4.2 [2013-07-15]
o Added argument 'sep' to devEval() together with an option to set
  its default value.


Version: 2.4.1 [2013-07-12]
o Updated how vignettes are built and included.


Version: 2.4.0 [2013-07-03]
o Now devNew() returns the index of the opened device.
o Now devEval() and devNew(), and hence toPNG() and so on, can be
  called without attaching the package, e.g. R.devices::toPNG().
o CLEANUP: Now package only imports the R.utils.  However, it will
  attach ("load") R.utils as soon as devEval() or devNew() is called.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 2.3.0 [2013-05-30]
o Now the package vignette is built via the R (>= 3.0.0) vignette engines,
  if available.


Version: 2.2.4 [2013-05-20]
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.


Version: 2.2.3 [2013-04-04]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now devEval() does a better job of making sure to close
  the same device as it opened.  Previously it would close the current
  active device, which would not be the correct one if for instance
  other devices had been open in the meanwhile/in parallel.


Version: 2.2.2 [2013-04-01]
o Now package builds with both R.rsp (< 0.9.1) and R.rsp (>= 0.9.1).


Version: 2.2.1 [2013-03-28]
o Bumped up package dependencies.
o Cleaned up the NAMESPACE file.


Version: 2.2.0 [2013-03-07]
o DOCUMENTATION: Preparing package vignettes for the upcoming
  R 3.0.0 support for non-Sweave vignettes.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 2.1.6 [2013-02-13]
o Changed default argument 'field' for devEval() from NULL to
  getOption("devEval/args/field", NULL).
o Changed default argument 'field' for toNNN() from "fullname"
  to getOption("devEval/args/field", "fullname").


Version: 2.1.5 [2013-02-13]
o Specifying new DESCRIPTION field 'VignetteBuilder'.


Version: 2.1.4 [2012-12-19]
o Utilizing new startupMessage() of R.oo.


Version: 2.1.3 [2012-11-19]
o DOCUMENTATION: Minor corrections and clarifications in the vignette.
o CONSISTENCY: Now using throw() instead of stop() everywhere.
o CLEANUP: Only importing what is necessary from R.methodsS3 and R.oo.
o CLEANUP: Made all integer constants truly integers.


Version: 2.1.2 [2012-08-21]
o DOCUMENTATION: Fixed minor typo in the vignette.
o DOCUMENTATION: In help(devEval) the link to help(devNew) was broken.
o Updated versions of the package dependencies.


Version: 2.1.1 [2012-05-01]
o Now devOptions() returns options invisibly if some options were set,
  otherwise not, e.g. devOptions() versus devOptions("png", width=1024).
o Added a first draft of a package vignette.


Version: 2.1.0 [2012-04-27]
o Merged updates from the R.utils v1.13.1.


Version: 2.0.0 [2011-11-05]
o Created package by extracting all methods in R.utils v1.9.1 that
  are related to graphical devices.
o The below change log shows the changes to the device methods while
  they were in R.utils.  For this reason, we choose to set the version
  of this package such that it starts where we left R.utils.


Version: 1.9.1 [2011-11-05]
o Added devOptions().
o Added default 'width' and 'height' values to eps().
o Turned png2() and jpeg2() into plain functions without a generic.
  This is consistent with how eps() is defined.
o GENERALIZATION: Now the default 'width' is inferred from
  devOptions() if needed.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added an example to help(devEval).


Version: 1.8.6 [2011-10-31]
o Added argument 'field' to devEval().


Version: 1.8.2 [2011-09-24]
o devNew() no longer gives a warning about argument 'aspectRatio' is
  specified when both or neither of 'width' and 'height' are given,
  and 'aspectRatio' is 1.


Version: 1.7.5 [2011-04-12]
o Now devEval("jpg", ...) is recognized as devEval("jpeg", ...).


Version: 1.7.3 [2011-04-02]
o Now argument 'force' of devEval() defaults to
  getOption("devEval/args/force", TRUE).


Version: 1.7.2 [2011-03-18]
o Now argument 'path' of devEval() defaults to
  getOption("devEval/args/path", "figures/").
o Now devEval() does a better job of "cleaning up" 'name' and 'tags'.


Version: 1.7.1 [2011-03-18]
o devNew() gained option 'devNew/args/par', which can be used to specify
  the default graphical parameters for devNew().  Any additional
  parameters passed via argument 'par' will override such default ones,
  if both specifies the same parameter.
o The automatic archiving of devEval() is not considered unless
  the R.archive package is loaded, regardless of option settings.
o DOCUMENTATION: The title of help(devDone) was incorrect.


Version: 1.7.0 [2011-03-10]
o Now argument 'aspectRatio' of devNew() defaults to 1 (not NULL).
o REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH: Now devEval() archives any generated
  image files if R.archive option 'devEval' is TRUE.


Version: 1.6.3 [2011-02-20]
o Added argument 'par' to devNew() for applying graphical parameters
  at the same time as the device is opened, which is especially
  useful when using devEval().
o Changed argument 'force' of devEval() to default to TRUE.


Version: 1.6.2 [2011-02-14]
o Added trial version of devEval() for simple creation of images.
o Added argument 'aspectRatio' to devNew(), which updates/sets
  the 'height' or the 'width', if the one of the other is not given.


Version: 1.5.5 [2010-10-26]
o Now argument 'which' to devSet() can be any object.  If not a
  single numeric or a single character string, then a checksum
  character string is generated using digest::digest(which).


Version: 1.0.8 [2008-10-16]
o Now devDone(which=1) does nothing.  Before it gave an error.
o BUG FIX: Argument 'type' of devNew() did not take function:s.


Version: 1.0.6 [2008-09-08]
o Now devNew() filters out arguments 'file' and 'filename' if the
  device is interactive.


Version: 1.0.4 [2008-08-01]
o Added several functions for extending the current functions dealing
  with devices.  All added functions can address a device by a label
  in addition to the standard device index.  The devGetLabel() and
  devSetLabel() gets and sets the label of a give device.  devList()
  lists the indices of existing device named by their labels, cf.
  dev.list().  The functions devSet() and devOff() work like
  dev.set() and dev.off() but accept labels as well.  Furthermore,
  devSet(idx) will open a device with index 'idx' if it does not
  exists, and devSet(label) a device with that label if not already
  opened.  The devIsOpen() checks if a device is open or not. The
  devDone() function calls devOff() except for screen devices.


Version: 1.0.0 [2008-02-26]
o The default filename for eps() had extension *.ps not *.eps.


Version: 0.7.6 [2006-02-15]
o Since the png2() and jpeg2() devices are in this package, the eps()
  device from R.graphics has been moved here for consistency.


Version: 0.6.0 [2005-09-24]
o Added trial versions of jpeg2() and png2().
