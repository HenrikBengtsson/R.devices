\title{Package R.devices}


\description{
  This package provides functions for creating plots and image files in a unified way regardless of output format (EPS, PDF, PNG, SVG, TIFF, WMF, etc.).  Default device options as well as scales and aspect ratios are controlled in a uniform way across all device types.  Switching output format requires minimal changes in code.  This package is ideal for large-scale batch processing, because it will never leave open graphics devices or incomplete image files behind, even on errors or user interrupts.
