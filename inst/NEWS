Package: R.devices
==================

Version: 2.5.0 [2013-07-30]
o Added support the 'win.metafile' (WMF) device type and added toWMF()
  creating (extended) WMF files.  Since the file format is *extended*
  WMF, which often has file extension *.emf, toEMF() was also added.
  toEMF() uses the same device driver as toWMF() with the only
  difference that the file extension is *.emf instead of *.wmf.
o Now devOptions() can query the options of multiple device types.
  Added arguments 'options' and 'drop' to devOptions().
o Now devEval() returns a list of class 'DevEvalFile'.
o DOCUMENTATION: Hiding internal/legacy functions from the help index.


Version: 2.4.2 [2013-07-15]
o Added argument 'sep' to devEval() together with an option to set
  its default value.


Version: 2.4.1 [2013-07-12]
o Updated how vignettes are built and included.


Version: 2.4.0 [2013-07-03]
o Now devNew() returns the index of the opened device.
o Now devEval() and devNew(), and hence toPNG() and so on, can be
  called without attaching the package, e.g. R.devices::toPNG().
o CLEANUP: Now package only imports the R.utils.  However, it will
  attach ("load") R.utils as soon as devEval() or devNew() is called.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 2.3.0 [2013-05-30]
o Now the package vignette is built via the R (>= 3.0.0) vignette engines,
  if available.


Version: 2.2.4 [2013-05-20]
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.


Version: 2.2.3 [2013-04-04]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now devEval() does a better job of making sure to close
  the same device as it opened.  Previously it would close the current
  active device, which would not be the correct one if for instance
  other devices had been open in the meanwhile/in parallel.


Version: 2.2.2 [2013-04-01]
o Now package builds with both R.rsp (< 0.9.1) and R.rsp (>= 0.9.1).


Version: 2.2.1 [2013-03-28]
o Bumped up package dependencies.
o Cleaned up the NAMESPACE file.


Version: 2.2.0 [2013-03-07]
o DOCUMENTATION: Preparing package vignettes for the upcoming
  R 3.0.0 support for non-Sweave vignettes.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 2.1.6 [2013-02-13]
o Changed default argument 'field' for devEval() from NULL to
  getOption("devEval/args/field", NULL).
o Changed default argument 'field' for toNNN() from "fullname"
  to getOption("devEval/args/field", "fullname").


Version: 2.1.5 [2013-02-13]
o Specifying new DESCRIPTION field 'VignetteBuilder'.


Version: 2.1.4 [2012-12-19]
o Utilizing new startupMessage() of R.oo.


Version: 2.1.3 [2012-11-19]
o DOCUMENTATION: Minor corrections and clarifications in the vignette.
o CONSISTENCY: Now using throw() instead of stop() everywhere.
o CLEANUP: Only importing what is necessary from R.methodsS3 and R.oo.
o CLEANUP: Made all integer constants truly integers.


Version: 2.1.2 [2012-08-21]
o DOCUMENTATION: Fixed minor typo in the vignette.
o DOCUMENTATION: In help(devEval) the link to help(devNew) was broken.
o Updated versions of the package dependencies.


Version: 2.1.1 [2012-05-01]
o Now devOptions() returns options invisibly if some options were set,
  otherwise not, e.g. devOptions() versus devOptions("png", width=1024).
o Added a first draft of a package vignette.


Version: 2.1.0 [2012-04-27]
o Merged updates from the R.utils v1.13.1.


Version: 2.0.0 [2011-11-05]
o Created package by extracting all methods in R.utils v1.9.1 that
  are related to graphical devices.
o The below change log shows the changes to the device methods while
  they were in R.utils.  For this reason, we choose to set the version
  of this package such that it starts where we left R.utils.


Version: 1.9.1 [2011-11-05]
o Added devOptions().
o Added default 'width' and 'height' values to eps().
o Turned png2() and jpeg2() into plain functions without a generic.
  This is consistent with how eps() is defined.
o GENERALIZATION: Now the default 'width' is inferred from
  devOptions() if needed.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added an example to help(devEval).


Version: 1.8.6 [2011-10-31]
o Added argument 'field' to devEval().


Version: 1.8.2 [2011-09-24]
o devNew() no longer gives a warning about argument 'aspectRatio' is
  specified when both or neither of 'width' and 'height' are given,
  and 'aspectRatio' is 1.


Version: 1.7.5 [2011-04-12]
o Now devEval("jpg", ...) is recognized as devEval("jpeg", ...).


Version: 1.7.3 [2011-04-02]
o Now argument 'force' of devEval() defaults to
  getOption("devEval/args/force", TRUE).


Version: 1.7.2 [2011-03-18]
o Now argument 'path' of devEval() defaults to
  getOption("devEval/args/path", "figures/").
o Now devEval() does a better job of "cleaning up" 'name' and 'tags'.


Version: 1.7.1 [2011-03-18]
o devNew() gained option 'devNew/args/par', which can be used to specify
  the default graphical parameters for devNew().  Any additional
  parameters passed via argument 'par' will override such default ones,
  if both specifies the same parameter.
o The automatic archiving of devEval() is not considered unless
  the R.archive package is loaded, regardless of option settings.
o DOCUMENTATION: The title of help(devDone) was incorrect.


Version: 1.7.0 [2011-03-10]
o Now argument 'aspectRatio' of devNew() defaults to 1 (not NULL).
o REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH: Now devEval() archives any generated
  image files if R.archive option 'devEval' is TRUE.


Version: 1.6.3 [2011-02-20]
o Added argument 'par' to devNew() for applying graphical parameters
  at the same time as the device is opened, which is especially
  useful when using devEval().
o Changed argument 'force' of devEval() to default to TRUE.


Version: 1.6.2 [2011-02-14]
o Added trial version of devEval() for simple creation of images.
o Added argument 'aspectRatio' to devNew(), which updates/sets
  the 'height' or the 'width', if the one of the other is not given.


Version: 1.5.5 [2010-10-26]
o Now argument 'which' to devSet() can be any object.  If not a
  single numeric or a single character string, then a checksum
  character string is generated using digest::digest(which).


Version: 1.0.8 [2008-10-16]
o Now devDone(which=1) does nothing.  Before it gave an error.
o BUG FIX: Argument 'type' of devNew() did not take function:s.


Version: 1.0.6 [2008-09-08]
o Now devNew() filters out arguments 'file' and 'filename' if the
  device is interactive.


Version: 1.0.4 [2008-08-01]
o Added several functions for extending the current functions dealing
  with devices.  All added functions can address a device by a label
  in addition to the standard device index.  The devGetLabel() and
  devSetLabel() gets and sets the label of a give device.  devList()
  lists the indices of existing device named by their labels, cf.
  dev.list().  The functions devSet() and devOff() work like
  dev.set() and dev.off() but accept labels as well.  Furthermore,
  devSet(idx) will open a device with index 'idx' if it does not
  exists, and devSet(label) a device with that label if not already
  opened.  The devIsOpen() checks if a device is open or not. The
  devDone() function calls devOff() except for screen devices.


Version: 1.0.0 [2008-02-26]
o The default filename for eps() had extension *.ps not *.eps.


Version: 0.7.6 [2006-02-15]
o Since the png2() and jpeg2() devices are in this package, the eps()
  device from R.graphics has been moved here for consistency.


Version: 0.6.0 [2005-09-24]
o Added trial versions of jpeg2() and png2().
